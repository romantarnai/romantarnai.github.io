            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Firstly in 1950's Subaru focused on making people's cars, which were small
                easily affordable vehicles. In 80's they've decided to go to motorsport. Their
                choice was rally.
            <p>
            <p>
                At first they hadn't had much success, but then they've started shining. They had
                probably the most famous rally driver of all time Colin McRae and he used the famous impreza.
                It was packed with 4 door, all wheel drive, boxer_engine. Then they made turbocharged version
                named WRX and they've starded selling them in Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1994 they introduced the STI verson of WRX, which was better faster version of WRX.
                In 1995 they have won wrc title and they went for headtrick. As celebration they introduced
                Impreza 22b, which was true rally car for street. They've started selling cars to whole world
                and in 2006 you could buy the hawk-eye version of WRX, by 2008 STI versions were made only
                in hatchback versions, which are sold to this day.

                <p class="image-description">
                    Boxer engine's pistons move horizontally like boxer's fist.
                    They are flat so they give car lowered center of gravity, so
                    it has better stability.

                    started in rally, mainly because they were rally giants, that
                    no one could compare with.
